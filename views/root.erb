<h1>Welcome to the Nested Forms Lab!<h1>

<p>Where you can build the pirate of your dreams</p>

<body>
<ul>
  <li>Note: YOU DO NOT NEED A DATABASE, since we just need to keep track of the form's input long enough to display it, and not persist it.  We don't expect the pirate to be there the next time we come to their URL, but it'd be cool if they were.</li>

  <li>1. Create two classes, a `Pirate` class and a `Ship` class. Pirates should have a name, weight, and height. You will also need a class method that returns all the pirates. The ship class should have name, type, and booty attributes, as well as a class method `.all` that returns all the ships and a class method `.clear` that deletes all ships.</li>
  
  <li>2. Make a nested form (this should probably have html
  <label>`s so it makes sense to a user). This form will be creating three objects (one instance of the Pirate class, and two instances of the Ship class). Remember, you'll need to build a corresponding controller action to load this page. Your form should `POST` to the route `'/pirates'`. </li>
  </ul>
